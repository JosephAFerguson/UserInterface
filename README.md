I started with the basic template and then added the html tags I needed. I gave them classes and id's that made sense with the layout I had faintly in my mind. I then added styles. Not good looking, but a variety to try and show what I've learned. This was the final result of coding activity 1.

Doing coding activity 2 I added the script, with the event listener and template entries and functions. I then decided I wanted the "stats" to be at the top of the screen, and the past entries at the bottom of the screen so I added those accordingly in my html and css. I filled out the template functions. Here I decided I wanted three faces to change with my current mood, so I added more svg shapes. After those additions I was finished. This was the final result of coding activity 2.

I get these new stats at the top of my screen:

  I started with the advanced javascript tutorial linked. Fortunately, I have already had a little experience with javascript so reviewing this material was not too hard. I then completely the part 1 of the homework - the advanced javascript questions.
  After this I followed throught the svelte tutorial, downloaded vscode, node.jc, and setup my svelte project folder in vscode for project 1. This completeled one task for the svelte part of this HW.
  The next things to do were to contribute to project 1. I will link that here [Project 1](readmes/Project1_README.md).

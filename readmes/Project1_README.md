### Introduction to Project 1
Project 1 is an individual project aimed at helping a user record their journey. 
Whether it be health, hobbies, sports, skills, financial, this project is meant to help them track their progress on this journey. 
Students are supposed to pick one of these themes and design an application around this. 
Students are expected to scetch potential interfaces, interview potential users, or just regular people to help with the design process. 
Once they are done with prototyping the interface, they will create a mock user for the application and then start developing it in steps.
Here is my documentation of my work on project 1.
